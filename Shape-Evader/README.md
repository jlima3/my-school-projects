# Shape Evader

## Explanation:
- Game is a simple 2D scroller, in which you must beat the times and get to the end in one piece.

- There is no story, just a ship of your choosing, with their unique attributes, and you must traverse the void, avoiding all the shapes in the way.

- There are a couple powerups, health and boost, and you have a boost mechanism that makes the shapes move faster across the screen, and the boost replenishes as foes leave screen.

- Some enemies take into account the location of the player and spawn accordingly.-
